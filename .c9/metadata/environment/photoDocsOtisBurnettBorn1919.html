Pelier Church to the Washington County line, and on to Sandersvillie, as soon as possible.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work on building up the road is being held up on account of Balwin County failing to put in a fill at Town creek, about thirteen miles out of Milledgeville on the Sandersville road, it is understood. A new modern type bridge was completed over Town creek some three or four months ago, though no effort is being made to complete the work of putting in the fill at the ends of the bridge and for such reason the highway commission engineer is complaining of being unable to start the work of building up the road.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road from Milledgeville to Sandersville is one of the most important highways leading out of the city and for such reason it is the purpose of Engineer Greenslade to commence work on it at the earliest date possible. It is understood that no promises have been made by the Baldwin county commissioners to put the finishing touches on the bridge work at Town creek at anything like an early date. Whether or not there is a possibility of the highway commission continuing to entertain the idea of putting in the extensive work on the road to the Washington line without the early cooperation of the Baldwin commissioners is not known.</p>","            </div>","        </div>","        ","        <div class=\"col-12 col-md-1\">","        </div>","        ","    </div><!--closes fourth row-->","    ","    <div class=\"row\" id=\"WmG1891(5)\"><!--fifth row-->","         ","        <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-1\">","        </div>","        ","        <div class=\"col-12 col-md-10\">","            <div id=\"p1of2\" onclick=\"twoPageFirstFlip()\">","                <img class=\"img-fluid hover\" src=\"images/infoWilliamGreensladeBorn1891(2A).jpg\">","                 <p>Information on file at R.E.

Pelier Church to the Washington County line, and on to Sandersvillie, as soon as possible.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work on building up the road is being held up on account of Balwin County failing to put in a fill at Town creek, about thirteen miles out of Milledgeville on the Sandersville road, it is understood. A new modern type bridge was completed over Town creek some three or four months ago, though no effort is being made to complete the work of putting in the fill at the ends of the bridge and for such reason the highway commission engineer is complaining of being unable to start the work of building up the road.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road from Milledgeville to Sandersville is one of the most important highways leading out of the city and for such reason it is the purpose of Engineer Greenslade to commence work on it at the earliest date possible. It is understood that no promises have been made by the Baldwin county commissioners to put the finishing touches on the bridge work at Town creek at anything like an early date. Whether or not there is a possibility of the highway commission continuing to entertain the idea of putting in the extensive work on the road to the Washington line without the early cooperation of the Baldwin commissioners is not known.</p>","            </div>","        </div>","        ","        <div class=\"col-12 col-md-1\">","        </div>","        ","    </div><!--closes fourth row-->","    ","    <div class=\"row\" id=\"WmG1891(5)\"><!--fifth row-->","         ","        <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-1\">","        </div>","        ","        <div class=\"col-12 col-md-10\">","            <div id=\"p1of2\" onclick=\"twoPageFirstFlip()\">","                <img class=\"img-fluid hover\" src=\"images/infoWilliamGreensladeBorn1891(2A).jpg\">","                 <p>Information on file at R.E.
